    <h1>About Me</h1> 
    
    <p>Hello I am Molina, I'm a student at Cerritos College and I am going for an Associates in Programming and am hoping to transfer to Calstate Monteray Bay. I am currently working a full-time job at Rivian Automotive and going to school part-time. I want to get a Bachelor's in Computer Science and hopefully get a career as a programmer. I would like to aim to be a video game programmer, but if not I would like to stay with electric automotive, or aerospace.</p>
